Pseudocode:
Huffmanâ€™s algorithm requires first determining the probability (or frequency of occurrence, or count) of each of the possible N symbols as 
they occur in the information source to be coded.For example, suppose:the possible items are the symbols A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H (so N=8)
and the message sequence to be coded is AAAAABBAHHBCBGCCC (so K=17).

1st Step: Determinr Frequencies:
Using a completely filled trie, we could construct a code for the possible symbols that would use log 2 (8) * 17 = 51 bits to represent this sequence
But we can do better! The table of counts or frequencies for this message would be:
A: 6; B: 4; C: 4; D: 0; E: 0; F: 0; G: 1; H: 2
